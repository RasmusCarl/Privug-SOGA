## Contents
This repository contains the code to repoduce the experiments in the paper "Quantifying Privacy Risks with Gaussian Mixtures".

To reproduce all the plots in the paper run the notebook `SOSYM_Experiments`.

All programs used in the experiments can be found in the folder `programs/SOGA/Privug/rasmus`.
