# Inference for Stan model: timeseries5_model
# 1 chains: each with iter=(4096000); warmup=(0); thin=(1); 4096000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took 0.032 seconds
# Sampling took 2.7 minutes
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
